* Description

- Hosts File Symbolic Link Manager
- quickly switch between multiple hosts files

* Usage

- *Backup your hosts file, there are currently no safety features to detect if the file linked is a legit hosts file*
- don't run with sudo
- symlinking to the hosts file calls sudo command on it's own
- pass no options for help/usage

** Directories

- put hostsm.sh in /bin/ folder for quick access

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mv hostsm.sh /bin/hostsm
chmod +x hostsm
#+END_SRC

- hosts files are put in ~/.config/hostsm

* Compatibility

- all GNU/LINUX Distributions which use the /etc/hosts file
- MacOS (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave)
- MacOS Catalania user can manually change the script to route to /private/etc/hosts
- Windows: currently not supported, planned

* Recommended HOSTS Files

* Use cases

- quickly enable or disable social media
- probably a lot more

** Alias

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
alias social-media-off=hostsm -f [name of HOSTS file that blocks social media]
alias social-media-on=hostsm -f [name of HOSTS file that allows social media]
#+END_SRC

* TODO

- detect if user is running MacOS Catalania and change hosts location to /private/etc/hosts
- make a batch script which works on Windows (example: https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/updateHostsWindows.bat)
- tidy up script
- automatically install script, etc
- beginner friendly documentation
- print name of currently used hosts file
- autocomplete file name

hostsm is free/libre software.
